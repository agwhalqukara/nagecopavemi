She is the daughter of Helen and Joseph Fahey, and she has two sisters, Máire and Niamh. Máire played the title role in the 1982 Dexys Midnight Runners music video "Come On Eileen," and Niamh is an editor and producer. After Joseph joined the British Army, the family lived in England and Germany. When Siobhan was 14 years old, she moved to Harpenden, Hertfordshire, England with her family, and two years later, she left for London, where she got involved with the punk scene.</p><h2 id=bananarama><strong>Bananarama</strong></h2><p>While taking a fashion journalism course at the London College of Fashion, Fahey met <a href=#>Sara Dallin</a>. The two formed Bananarama with <a href=#>Keren Woodward</a> in 1981 and released several singles with the Fun Boy Three the following year. The singles "It Ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)" and "Really Saying Something" were certified Silver in the U.K., and both reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, Belgian Ultratop chart, and Irish Singles Chart.</p><p>Bananarama released their debut album, "Deep Sea Skiving," in March 1983, and it reached #7 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Silver in the U.K. The album included the hit singles "Shy Boy," and "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye," which both reached the top 10 in the U.K. and Ireland. Their follow-up, 1984's "Bananarama," reached #16 on the UK Albums Chart and #9 on the Swiss Hitparade chart.</p><p>The singles "Cruel Summer" and "<a href=# title="Robert De Niro Net Worth">Robert De Niro</a>'s Waiting…" were top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart. Next, the band released the 1986 album "True Confessions," which was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in the U.S. The album included the single "Venus," which would become their biggest hit, topping the charts in seven countries and going Platinum in Canada and Silver in France and the U.K. Fahey left Bananarama after the release of the 1987 album "Wow!," which reached #1 on the Australian Albums chart and went Gold in the U.K. and Canada.

Shakespears Sister became a duo after Siobhan began collaborating with singer/songwriter Marcella Detroit, and they released the albums "Sacred Heart" (1989) and "Hormonally Yours" (1992). Both albums reached the top 10 on the UK Albums Chart, and "Hormonally Yours" was certified 2× Platinum in the U.K. and featured the #1 single "Stay." In 1993, the duo split up, and Siobhan checked herself into a psychiatric unit while suffering from severe depression. She later switched Shakespears Sister back to a solo project and released the albums "#3" (2004) and "Songs from the Red Room" (2009), and in 2019, she reunited with Detroit for the "Shakespears Sister Ride Again" tour. In 2005, Fahey released the solo album "The MGA Sessions."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>On August 1, 1987, Siobhan married <a href=#>Dave Stewart</a>, who is best known for being a member of Eurythmics alongside <a href=#>Annie Lennox</a>. Fahey and Stewart welcomed sons Samuel (born 1987) and Django (born 1991) before divorcing in 1996.

When Samuel was a baby, he appeared in the Shakespears Sister music videos "You're History" and "Heroine." Before marrying Stewart, Fahey dated Stiff Little Fingers drummer Jim Reilly and The Bluebells singer Bobby Bluebell.
