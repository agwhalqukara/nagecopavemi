In <a href=#>What did Dillon Danis say about Joe Rogan? MMA fighter gets hit by community note after taking swipe at podcast host</a>, we delve into the intense build-up, the fight itself, and the aftermath that followed.</p><p>Months of anticipation, social media hype, and legal disputes led to the showdown between former UFC fighter Dillon Danis and social media sensation Logan Paul. As the fight unfolded, it became clear that Logan Paul had the upper hand, leaving Danis struggling to make a significant impact. Despite his self-congratulatory tone on social media, many criticized Danis for his lackluster performance and inflated sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Following the fight, Danis’s post-fight comments on social media, including a swipe at Joe Rogan, sparked a backlash. Twitter users quickly debunked his claim, highlighting that Rogan had never compared their fighting skills but merely noted their involvement in influencer fights for monetary gain. The online response to Danis’s post was far from sympathetic, with many questioning his pride in a performance that saw him out-struck 80-9.</p><p>Looking ahead, Danis’s future in the world of mixed martial arts remains uncertain. While he has been praised for his trolling skills, his exaggerated sense of achievement and continued trash-talking may have damaged his reputation and future opportunities. As both fighters move forward, it remains to be seen whether Danis will learn from this experience or continue down the path of controversial self-promotion. And for Joe Rogan, the misplaced comparison is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Dillon_Danis_vs_Logan_Paul_Brawl></span>The Dillon Danis vs. Logan Paul Brawl<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The highly anticipated brawl between Dillon Danis and Logan Paul captivated audiences with months of anticipation, social media hype, and legal disputes.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Anticipation_and_Hype></span>Anticipation and Hype<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Leading up to the fight, the clash between a former UFC fighter and a social media sensation generated immense excitement. Fans eagerly awaited the showdown, fueled by relentless trash talk and a heated rivalry between the two fighters.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Logan_Paul_Emerges_Victorious></span>Logan Paul Emerges Victorious<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the end, it was Logan Paul who emerged as the victor, leaving Dillon Danis struggling to make a significant impact on the fight. Despite Danis’s background as a skilled former jiu-jitsu world champion, he found himself struggling to land meaningful punches throughout the match. By the end of four rounds, he had only managed to connect with nine punches. The stark difference in their fighting skills was evident when Danis even threw himself to the ground, almost inviting Logan Paul to grapple with him.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mixed_Feelings_about_the_Outcome></span>Mixed Feelings about the Outcome<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The fight’s outcome left many fans with mixed feelings.

Many questioned his seemingly inflated sense of accomplishment and labeled his actions as shameless.</p><p>Despite the online backlash, Dillon Danis remains a polarizing figure in the world of mixed martial arts. However, his chances of securing an invitation to the Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) podcast may have diminished after this performance.

The bout between Danis and Logan Paul was more than just a fight; it was a clash of egos and a spectacle for social media audiences.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dillon_Daniss_Struggles_in_the_Fight></span>Dillon Danis’s Struggles in the Fight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/362672175_fighter-countdown-min.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Dillon Danis faced several challenges during his bout against Logan Paul, which ultimately led to his defeat.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lack_of_Impactful_Punches></span>Lack of Impactful Punches<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Throughout the fight, Danis struggled to land impactful punches on his opponent.
