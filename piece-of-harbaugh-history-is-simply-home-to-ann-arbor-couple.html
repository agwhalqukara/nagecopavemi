Then they started introducing themselves. There was an older man — Jack — his adult son John, and John’s daughter, Alison. It was the Harbaugh family, back to visit their old Ann Arbor home.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The family wandered around a little, then told stories about John and Jim playing in the street, how they would “beat the hell out of each other” competing.</p><p>They never asked to come in.</p><p>“I guess they knew what it looked like inside,” Vanderhoof joked.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2017/08/31125939/IMG_1831-1024x683.jpg alt width=640 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Cherryl and Michael Vanderhoof now live in the home where Jim Harbaugh grew up. (Max Bultman / The Athletic)</span><p>Even before Michael and his wife Cherryl first moved into the house in 2014, their real estate agent mentioned something about Bo Schembechler and the Harbaughs having been there a lot. Once they moved in, neighbors popped by to tell them whose house it had been.</p><p>To many Ann Arborites, living in Jim Harbaugh’s old house on Anderson St. would be like renting out a slice of Michigan football history. To the Vanderhoofs, it’s just home.</p><p>Michael sometimes watches football, but the first time he ever went to Michigan Stadium was in 2010 for his daughter Micah’s college graduation. He watches a handful of games a year, but he’s not the type to schedule his whole weekend around it. Cherryl’s not too connected to the sport — though she too has had her brush with Michigan football history.</p><p>She once took a dance class with Vera Embree — a Michigan dance teacher who once suggested to Schembechler that his players take dance classes to help improve their agility and stop getting injured.</p><p>“He did, and they stopped having so many!” Cherryl recalled.</p><p>For the most part, the couple’s ties to Michigan football stop there. But there are a couple quirky coincidences that are too perfect to ignore.</p><p>Michael, for example, is a coach, too. It’s not football, or even dance, but Michael is a wellness coach — and a wellness coaches’ coach, at that. Working for a company called Mannatech, Michael teaches clients how to best use his company’s supplements, while also helping aspiring entrepreneurs build teams of salesmen to distribute the product.</p><p>“I look at, how can I help people eat better and supplement what’s missing out of the diet?” Michael explained.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Get him going, and he talks about glyconutrition the way Harbaugh talks about fullbacks. He can tell you why you should — and how to properly — consume aloe. He uses all the biology terms you’ve forgotten by now, and he coaches others on how to best achieve the elusive state of wellness. It’s a Harbaugh-like passion.</p><p>This is a man who, when he was younger, decided the corporate path wasn’t for him. He had all kinds of odd jobs — he attended General Motors Institute for a while, worked at a photo lab, painted, and more. He just didn’t know what would stick.</p><p>Eventually, though, he stumbled into the pursuit of wellness. He didn’t immediately make it his business — that came later — but it piqued his interest and set him on the path that led him to renting the house on Anderson St. all these years later.</p><p>Along the way, he met Cherryl, a flutist and music and dance teacher at Washtenaw Community College and the Ann Arbor Public Schools. He asked her for flute lessons — he wasn’t hitting on her at first, he says — and their love blossomed from there.</p><p>They now spend their days living in the quaint little neighborhood that raised two of football’s best active coaches, in a house with red shutters and an unexpectedly large backyard.</p><p>When the Harbaughs stopped by last month, the memories came rushing back for Jack. There was the backyard where they would freeze off a little area and set up a goalie net. There was the incline where, once upon a time, John forgot to put on the Volkswagen’s parking brake and the car rolled toward Packard — only ceasing when it ran into a stop sign. The back of the car, Jack recalled in a conversation with The Athletic, looked like an accordion.</p><p>“Those are the kind of memories you have when you come home,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57mGpuaWpfZ31yg45pb2hrYWS9qrHCnmSonl2drrOuwK6eoWWYnsC1u9GyZKKrXai2rrzLsmShp52aerW7jJqlp2WRp6%2Bwvoycpq6onJp8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wayne-swinny-wiki-age-height-net-worth-wife-ethnicity-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wayne Swinny- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity, Death">&larr;
