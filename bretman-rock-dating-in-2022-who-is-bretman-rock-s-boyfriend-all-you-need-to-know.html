He lives in Honolulu, Hawaii. In 2015, one of his videos about contouring went viral, which made him famous as a creator on YouTube and Vine. Rock is known for making videos about how to put on makeup and for having funny ideas about life. He has been in several music videos and was the first openly gay man to be on the cover of Playboy magazine in October 2021.</p><p><a href=#>Rock</a> has won many awards and honors for his work on social media, including a People’s Choice award for “Beauty Influencer” and an award for “Breakthrough Social Star” at the 2021 MTV Movie and TV Awards.</p><h2>Bretman Rock: Personal Life Details</h2><p>In November 2019, Rock’s father died after being in a coma for a while. 46. Sometimes, his mother Mercedita shows up in his videos.&nbsp;Rock is Ilocano.</p><p>Rock is out as gay, and he told Elle in September 2019 that he was in his first relationship. In April 2020, Rock asked fans on social media not to go to his house without an invitation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2>Bretman Rock Is Single</h2><p>The Filipina-American beauty blogger is single at the moment. On February 27, 2021, he joked about being single in a tweet.</p><p>He wrote, “You can call me Bret for now” because he didn’t have a boyfriend.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Bretman (Da Baddest) Rock (@bretmanrock)</a></p><p>In February 2021, Rock said that he was no longer with anyone.<br>Since the announcement, the social media star hasn’t talked about meeting someone new or starting a new relationship.</p><p>On his social media, he has also said nothing about who he dates. Still, he used to date a secret boyfriend in the open.</p><h2>Bretman Rock’s Dating History</h2><p>Even though he may be single right now, Rock was dating a man no one knew about in 2020.</p><p>In February 2020, he wrote on Twitter that he had told the world almost everything about his life, from high school to personal problems.</p><p>But he made it clear that he would rather keep his love life to himself. He also asked everyone to respect his choice.<br>In another tweet from the same day, he said that his (former) boyfriend didn’t have any social media accounts. He seemed a little upset that people were invading the privacy of the couple.</p><p>Also, in April 2020, he sent out another tweet that seemed angry. In the tweet, he told his followers that they wouldn’t be able to find his partner online and told them not to believe the “detective losers” who were making assumptions.</p><h2>Bretman Rock Announced Their Break Up</h2><p>The happiness didn’t last long, though, because Rock then broke up with her on Twitter. In his first tweet, he wrote, “Girl, I’ve got something to tell you all…”</p><p>Then, in a second tweet, he asked his followers to do something strange. The comic asked readers to find Big Sean’s fifth suggested song on Spotify. “Single Again” was the song in question. That was a very different way to break up with someone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/bretman-rock.jpg><p>But before he said it for sure, Rock posted a vlog with the title “Get ready for a Zoom date with me!” that seemed to hint at the breakup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5e%2FpsDMmqVmqp%2BYuG6wwK2gp59dmbK1rcilqmhqYG6Gd3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gaben-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gaben Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki">&larr;
